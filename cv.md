## About me
I have successfully completed the introductory course of Rolling Scopes School, having received a certificate. At the moment I have started training on stage1. At the moment I have experience in layout and JavaScript. My main goal is to learn how to create cool projects that I can be proud of and feel that I have done something very cool in my life. My plans are to create my own, large and complex project, the idea of which has been in my head for a long time (secret information) and at the moment I am gaining knowledge to implement it. In addition, I plan to create other projects on my own and in a team of cool people.

  }

  let result = '';
  for (key in arguments) {
      result += (hex(arguments[key]).length < 2) ? '0' + hex(arguments[key]) : hex(arguments[key]);
